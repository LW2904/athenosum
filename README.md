[Athenaeum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenaeum) + [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home)

This is a library with some really basic stuff that I wrote while working on a number of osu! related stuff. For now, I'm just copying stuff over from [maniac](https://github.com/LW2904/maniac) as I need it, but maybe this will eventually outgrow it.

Expect this to be messy and unstable, I experiment a lot. Don't even think of reusing anything here.
