[Athenaeum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenaeum) + [osu!](https://osu.ppy.sh/home)

This is a library with some really basic stuff that I wrote while working on a number of osu! related things. For now, I'm really just moving the functions implemented in [maniac](https://github.com/LW2904/maniac) over here, and doing some cleanup while I'm at it.

Expect this to be messy and unstable. I'm really only making this because I don't want to keep copying the same code over and over again, that's just a horrible workflow.
