### athen`osu!`m

_The [Athenaeum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Athenaeum) for osu!._

This is a library with some really basic stuff that I wrote while working on a number of osu! related things. For now, I'm really just moving the functions implemented in [maniac](https://github.com/LW2904/maniac) over here and doing some cleanup while I'm at it.

Expect this to be messy and unstable (just like maniac, coincidentally). I'm really only throwing this stuff together as a library because it'll allow for quicker and easier prototyping of new ideas, so chances are it'll stay that way.

#### Installation

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
sudo make install
```

You will find the (shared) library and all public headers in their respective default directories.
